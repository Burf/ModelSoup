# Model Soups

This is an implementation of "Model Soups" on Keras, Tensorflow and Torch.

The implementation is based on paper[[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05482v1)].

## Method
- Uniform Soup
- Greedy Soup

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Tensorflow2 or Torch

## Reference

 1. Model soups: averaging weights of multiple fine-tuned models improves accuracy without increasing inference time,
